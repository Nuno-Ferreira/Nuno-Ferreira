# Currency converter

I am building this app since I always have the need to know the conversion rates between certain currencies at the press of a button. The method that I normally use is to search on the internet so I am building this to hopefully eliminate that issue. It will be packaged for Android and Windows.

## Disclaimer ðŸš¨
- **At this moment**, the app is not fully built nor is it packaged in any sort of way. It is currenly a work in progress as a personal project. I will eventually release an official release of the app.

## Built with

- **Python 3.10**
- **Toga GUI**
- **BeeWare virtual environment**


## Requirements

- Android 0.X
-

## Future improvements ðŸ“ˆ

- [ ] Create a pleasant UI (personal use).
- [ ] Error handling with invalid input of currencies and amounts.
- [ ] Add a function to tell me how many requests (API) I have left until the renewal period.
- [ ] Add a function to store the values of most converted currencies daily (to use even if offline).
- [ ] Add tests for the code.
