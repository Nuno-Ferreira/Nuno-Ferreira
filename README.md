# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 3rd year Robotics student that is trying to break into tech as a Software Developer. For my final year project I have chosen to do is building glasses that highlight the text that you read. Soon I will create a repo for me to start working on that project and hopefully succeed.
